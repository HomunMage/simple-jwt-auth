# Tiny Fullstack with React, FastAPI

A minimal, ready-to-deploy starter repository for building full-stack applications with React and FastAPI.  This is a personal learning and experimentation project, providing a solid foundation for more complex projects.

This is my fullstack template repo.

Frontend is React TypeScript, having Vite, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Router.

Backend is FastAPI, having Cron that you can scheduled such rolling backups or data processing.

Deployment support Docker Compose, Kubernetes

Release by github action, just by create new tag with ```vA.B.C``` it will auto package and upload
